# **Switcher For GTAV**
Simple GTAV utility to switch between game installs instantly

## Setup
1. Download latest release from [Releases](https://github.com/Isuru-A/Switcher-For-GTAV/releases)
2. Extract ZIP archive and open **Switcher.exe**
3. Click on (...) to open settings and define **Install Paths** and **Launcher**

## Notes
* **Steam versions of GTAV are currently unsupported**

* Installs do **NOT** need to be in the same directory
* Both install **MUST** be copies of each other, *i.e.*
  * Install 2, **MUST** have been a copy of Install 1 prior to being modded
  * Switcher will **NOT** work if both installs were downloaded seperately via the launcher

## Requirements
* .NET Framework
  * This should already be installed on your machine, if not download it [Here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework)
